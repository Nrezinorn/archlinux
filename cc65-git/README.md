Archlinux non-AUR'd packagebuild for cc65-git
---------------------------------------------
Created July 22, 2013

Special thanks to Oliver Schmidt for continuing development for this great Assembler.

Note: The current AUR package for cc65-svn was broken for me, I created this for Archlinux to continue my NES development.
