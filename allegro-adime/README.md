Archlinux non-AUR'd packagebuild for ADime
---------------------------------------------
Created May 17, 2025

Archlinux still contains a package for allegro4, however some allego-based games need/use [ADime](https://adime.sourceforge.net/) for dialog boxes.  This will make and install the library/package.  

Contains a patch for modern (x86_64) systems.
